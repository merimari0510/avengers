Thor decides to go to Nidavellir, since he intends to ask Eitri, King of the Dwarves, to forge a new weapon. Thor is accompanied by Rocket Raccoon and Groot while Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax and Mantis depart to Knowhere.","Remembering how Thanos destroyed half of his people and adopted her in the process, Gamora makes Quill promise to kill her if she is captured by Thanos.

Unfortunately, Thanos realizes the presence of the team after Mantis incapacitates Drax, who tried to approach and kill the Crazy Titan due to the death of his wife and daughter. Gamora goes on the offensive, quickly attacks and defeats Thanos, who falls to the ground, apparently killed.","However, the group discovers that Thanos has already acquired the Gem of Reality and has been using it to create this illusion.

Banner suggests asking Clinton Barton for help, but Rogers explains that he and Scott Lang are under house arrest, since they made deals with the United States government to stay with their families instead of being locked in the Raft.

Thanos tortures Nebula in front of Gamora in order to make her speak. Unable to bear witnessing this, Gamora reveals that the Soul Gem is hidden in Vormir.","Thanos and Gamora teleport to Vormir, where they meet Johann Schmidt, who is the current Guardian of the Gem. Schmidt tells Thanos that he has to sacrifice what he loves most to get the Soul Gem. This amuses Gamora, as she believes that Thanos does not love anyone or anything, so he cannot fulfill his plans. However, when Thanos cries for her, Gamora understands that Thanos really loves her. Despite Gamora's pleas, Thanos chooses to sacrifice his adopted daughter and is rewarded with the Soul Gem.","Meanwhile, Thor, Rocket and Groot land in Nidavellir, where the station is off. There they meet Eitri, now the only Dwarf left. They learn that Thanos ordered Eitri to forge the Infinity Gauntlet and paralyzed the Dwarf so that he could not forge anything else after this. However, Thor convinces Eitri that they can work together to beat Thanos. To do so, they plan to create a new weapon for Thor: the Stormbreaker.","Thor successfully reactivates the star nucleus of Nidavellir, but because the mechanisms of the forge were damaged, he is forced to risk his life to keep it on.

Since they can't find the ax's handle, Groot sacrifices his left arm so Thor can use the Stormbreaker.","In Ebony Maw's Q-Ship, Stark and Parker successfully rescue Strange by opening a hole in the ship to send Maw into space. While Strange decides that they should return to Earth, Stark suggests keeping the course set on Titan to carry out a surprise attack on Thanos, who will not know of their presence when they are there. Strange agrees, but warns Stark that his duty is to protect the Time Gem, even if it means sacrificing or letting Stark and Parker die.","Once the spacecraft lands on Titan, they are ambushed by the Guardians of the Galaxy, who have been directed there by Nebula and confuse them with subjects of Thanos. However, after a small duel, they realize that they are on the same side, against Thanos, so they decide to work together.

He then informs his allies that of the 14,000,605 finals he anticipated, there was only one where they were victorious.","Thanos arrives at Titan and is received by Strange. He gives a brief and passionate speech about how Titan was his home and that overpopulation led him to ruin, as well as being considered merciful, since with the Infinity Gems together he can eliminate half of the population in the universe without that they feel a lot of pain with the snap of their fingers, after which Thanos simply plans to rest. However, the heroes attack Thanos in an intense battle, but Thanos faces the tactics of the Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy and Strange until Nebula arrives, who distracts him.

However, when Nebula deduces that Thanos has killed Gamora, Quill becomes enraged and attacks the Crazy Titan, which makes him regain consciousness just when the Gauntlet was about to be taken from him.","The fight turns decisively in favor of Thanos, as it unleashes the strength of the Infinity Gems on its attackers.

As they try to go other ways to capture Vision, the Avengers decide to partially open the barrier to keep the enemies in front of them. The strategy works, but at the cost of massive hordes of Outriders that suddenly invade Wakanda, this leads to a fierce battle.","Although they are able to take down many creatures, the Avengers and Wakanda's armies are outnumbered. However, Thor arrives by invoking the Bifrost with Rocket and Groot, taking an unexpected turn during the battle, as Thor's Stormbreaker ends up with multiple enemy troops. The Dark Order resorts to the use of massive war machines, which leads Maximoff to leave his post to join the battle and help his allies.","However, this leaves Vision and Shuri exposed to Corvus Glaive, who infiltrated the lab to take the Vision Mind Gem. The latter tries to defend himself, but Corvus Glaive and Cull Obsidian dominate him. Banner arrives and manages to kill Cull Obsidian even though he still cannot become a Hulk while Rogers fights Corvus Glaive.

Thanos is momentarily transported to the World of the Soul, where he sees a young Gamora, who asks him what was the cost of achieving his goal. Sadly, Thanos confesses that he lost \xabeverything\xbb. Thanos then returns to the real world and Thor furiously questions him about what he did.

Although he hoped to fail, he discovers the key to doing so, solving how to navigate the current of time travel using a strip design based on the M\xf6bius. He talks to Potts about the morality of time travel and what he should do with his latest discovery: if he should lock it in a box and throw it at the bottom of the lake or not.

Vers has constant nightmares chasing her, which consist mainly of a plane crash in a deserted field and sees a woman killed in front of her by an unknown aggressor. She also has this experience as the first memory of herself since she gained her powers. Vers now trains tirelessly with Starforce Commander Yon-Rogg, with the goal of becoming a member of the team.

But upon learning of the death of his wife Robert fled in pain. Bova then introduced the two little ones to his master, the High Evolutionary, who decided to give Django and Marya Maximoff an adoption for a gypsy marriage who had lost their two children, Ana and Mateo during the war.","Thus the twins grew up with their new family until they reached adolescence and began to discover their mutant powers. When Django was forced to steal food to feed his hungry family, enraged villagers attacked the gypsy camp. Pietro managed to flee the camp with his sister thanks to his super speed, but the fact and circumstances of the separation from his family were so traumatic that they would not remember these details until their adulthood. For the following years, Wanda and Pietro roamed central Europe, feeding on what they could, Pietro always had a protective attitude towards his sister Wanda. One day Wanda accidentally caused a fire with his powers, causing a group of superstitious peasants to persecute her believing her a witch. Although Pietro tried to defend her, they were soon overtaken by the numerical superiority of their attackers and would have died possibly had it not been for the arrival of Magneto, who rescued them. They would ignore that it was their true father and Magneto without knowing that they were their children recruited them to join them to their Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, where they adopted the men of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch.","As members of the Brotherhood, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch helped Magneto in his terrorist campaigns against humanity and helped him fight the original members of the X-Men. For months they served Magneto for a feeling of obligation and fear of reprisals. Always unaware of the ties that bound them to the mutant leader.","When Magneto was defeated by the overwhelming powers of the Stranger (a cosmic entity), Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch left the Brotherhood; the Strange took Magneto away from Earth, and the Maximoff twins then returned to their native Transia.","Pietro and Wanda would soon find refuge with the group of Super-Heroes called The Avengers, who was reforming their ranks, in the absence of several of its members. The twins were included along with Hawkeye in the new team. Although the team was considered less powerful and capable than the previous one, these new avengers would soon prove themselves by beating Kang the Conqueror and Doctor Doom, and other threats. Although Captain America initially had many clashes with Quicksilver and Hawkeye that often rebelled against his orders, the Avengers leader would manage to mold them as valuable team members.","Since then Pietro would walk many times between the heroic and the villainy, because he felt that he sometimes did not fit on either side. He has been a member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, The Avengers, X-Factor, the Royal Family of the Inhumans, the Knights of Wundagore, The West Coast Avengers, the Genosha Cabinet among others. Endowed with prodigious speed Pietro is one of the fastest beings on the planet and one of the most complicated heroes that the wonderful Marvel universe has to offer us."],list_img:["../assets/img/portfolios/quicksilver/01.jpg","../assets/img/portfolios/quicksilver/02.jpg","../assets/img/portfolios/quicksilver/03.jpg","../assets/img/portfolios/quicksilver/04.jpg","../assets/img/portfolios/quicksilver/05.jpg","../assets/img/portfolios/quicksilver/06.jpg","../assets/img/portfolios/quicksilver/07.jpg","../assets/img/portfolios/quicksilver/08.jpg","../assets/img/portfolios/quicksilver/09.jpg"],img_portafolio_portada:"../assets/img/portfolios/quicksilver-portada.jpg",cite:"",cite_video:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/",video:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3HczWv6BvRw",actor_name:"Aaron Taylor-Johnson",list_movies_apears:["avengers-ultron","captain-america-the-winter-soldier"]},{name:"Scarlet Witch",name_short:"scarlet-witch",img_card:"card-scarlet-witch.jpg",description:"Mutant and member of the Avengers, Scarlet Witch used her powers to manipulate probability and alter reality in her effort to help the world.

Now with his super powers Peter would try to gain fame and fortune. Thinking of keeping his identity secret, in disguise he tested his new abilities by venturing into the world of Professional Struggle, then defeating even a fighter known as The Hogan Crusher. Then Peter, using his scientific genius, built a pair of artificial spiderweb launchers that he would use on his wrists.
