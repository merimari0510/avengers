Thor decides to go to Nidavellir, since he intends to ask Eitri, King of the Dwarves, to forge a new weapon. Thor is accompanied by Rocket Raccoon and Groot while Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax and Mantis depart to Knowhere.","Remembering how Thanos destroyed half of his people and adopted her in the process, Gamora makes Quill promise to kill her if she is captured by Thanos. When they arrive at Knowhere, the Guardians of the Galaxy witness how Thanos violently interrogates the Collector about the location of the Gem of Reality. Unfortunately, Thanos realizes the presence of the team after Mantis incapacitates Drax, who tried to approach and kill the Crazy Titan due to the death of his wife and daughter. Gamora goes on the offensive, quickly attacks and defeats Thanos, who falls to the ground, apparently killed.","However, the group discovers that Thanos has already acquired the Gem of Reality and has been using it to create this illusion. Thanos shows Knowhere burning in flames and himself alive. Thanos had expected Gamora to come and fight him, and he is aware that she is the only person who knows the location of the Soul Gem.

Banner suggests asking Clinton Barton for help, but Rogers explains that he and Scott Lang are under house arrest, since they made deals with the United States government to stay with their families instead of being locked in the Raft.

However, to accomplish this without killing Vision, Rogers suggests traveling to the most technologically advanced country in the world, Wakanda.","In Wakanda, T'Challa and Okoye receive the call from Rogers.

Thanos tortures Nebula in front of Gamora in order to make her speak. Unable to bear witnessing this, Gamora reveals that the Soul Gem is hidden in Vormir.","Thanos and Gamora teleport to Vormir, where they meet Johann Schmidt, who is the current Guardian of the Gem. Schmidt tells Thanos that he has to sacrifice what he loves most to get the Soul Gem. This amuses Gamora, as she believes that Thanos does not love anyone or anything, so he cannot fulfill his plans. However, when Thanos cries for her, Gamora understands that Thanos really loves her. Despite Gamora's pleas, Thanos chooses to sacrifice his adopted daughter and is rewarded with the Soul Gem.","Meanwhile, Thor, Rocket and Groot land in Nidavellir, where the station is off. There they meet Eitri, now the only Dwarf left. They learn that Thanos ordered Eitri to forge the Infinity Gauntlet and paralyzed the Dwarf so that he could not forge anything else after this. However, Thor convinces Eitri that they can work together to beat Thanos. To do so, they plan to create a new weapon for Thor: the Stormbreaker.","Thor successfully reactivates the star nucleus of Nidavellir, but because the mechanisms of the forge were damaged, he is forced to risk his life to keep it on. Thor is exposed to the powerful explosion of the Nidavellir star, which allows the metal to melt to create the Stormbreaker. Since they can't find the ax's handle, Groot sacrifices his left arm so Thor can use the Stormbreaker.","In Ebony Maw's Q-Ship, Stark and Parker successfully rescue Strange by opening a hole in the ship to send Maw into space. While Strange decides that they should return to Earth, Stark suggests keeping the course set on Titan to carry out a surprise attack on Thanos, who will not know of their presence when they are there. Strange agrees, but warns Stark that his duty is to protect the Time Gem, even if it means sacrificing or letting Stark and Parker die.","Once the spacecraft lands on Titan, they are ambushed by the Guardians of the Galaxy, who have been directed there by Nebula and confuse them with subjects of Thanos. However, after a small duel, they realize that they are on the same side, against Thanos, so they decide to work together. While the rest of them try to devise a plan, Strange uses the Time Gem to look for alternative futures. He then informs his allies that of the 14,000,605 finals he anticipated, there was only one where they were victorious.","Thanos arrives at Titan and is received by Strange. He gives a brief and passionate speech about how Titan was his home and that overpopulation led him to ruin, as well as being considered merciful, since with the Infinity Gems together he can eliminate half of the population in the universe without that they feel a lot of pain with the snap of their fingers, after which Thanos simply plans to rest. However, the heroes attack Thanos in an intense battle, but Thanos faces the tactics of the Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy and Strange until Nebula arrives, who distracts him. Eventually, they leave Thanos half unconscious and try to remove the Infinity Gauntlet. However, when Nebula deduces that Thanos has killed Gamora, Quill becomes enraged and attacks the Crazy Titan, which makes him regain consciousness just when the Gauntlet was about to be taken from him.","The fight turns decisively in favor of Thanos, as it unleashes the strength of the Infinity Gems on its attackers. Thanos confronts and defeats Strange, but realizes that Strange did not use the Time Gem because he had hidden it. Before he can try to locate him, Stark attacks him, but he is quickly overcome and seriously injured when Thanos stabs him in the stomach.

As they try to go other ways to capture Vision, the Avengers decide to partially open the barrier to keep the enemies in front of them. The strategy works, but at the cost of massive hordes of Outriders that suddenly invade Wakanda, this leads to a fierce battle.","Although they are able to take down many creatures, the Avengers and Wakanda's armies are outnumbered. However, Thor arrives by invoking the Bifrost with Rocket and Groot, taking an unexpected turn during the battle, as Thor's Stormbreaker ends up with multiple enemy troops. The Dark Order resorts to the use of massive war machines, which leads Maximoff to leave his post to join the battle and help his allies.","However, this leaves Vision and Shuri exposed to Corvus Glaive, who infiltrated the lab to take the Vision Mind Gem. The latter tries to defend himself, but Corvus Glaive and Cull Obsidian dominate him. Banner arrives and manages to kill Cull Obsidian even though he still cannot become a Hulk while Rogers fights Corvus Glaive. On the other hand, despite defending against the combined forces of Maximoff, Romanoff and Okoye, Proxima Midnight also dies.

He makes fun of Thor for not pointing at the head and snapping his fingers with the Infinity Gauntlet, carrying out his plan. Thanos is momentarily transported to the World of the Soul, where he sees a young Gamora, who asks him what was the cost of achieving his goal. Sadly, Thanos confesses that he lost \xabeverything\xbb. Thanos then returns to the real world and Thor furiously questions him about what he did. Thanos simply smiles and teleports while the effects of the Snap manifest: half of life in the universe is erased from existence, including James Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Wanda Maximoff and Samuel Wilson, leaving survivors to contemplate in horror, unable to do anything other than accept defeat.","On Titan, Mantis, Drax and Peter Quill disappear, along with Stephen Strange, who tells Stark that \xabit was the only way\xbb. Peter Parker also disintegrates and hugs Stark telling him he didn't want to leave, until he disappeared.

Although he hoped to fail, he discovers the key to doing so, solving how to navigate the current of time travel using a strip design based on the M\xf6bius. He talks to Potts about the morality of time travel and what he should do with his latest discovery: if he should lock it in a box and throw it at the bottom of the lake or not.

Barton performs the first time travel test and is transported to his farm before the Click is carried out.

Vers has constant nightmares chasing her, which consist mainly of a plane crash in a deserted field and sees a woman killed in front of her by an unknown aggressor. She also has this experience as the first memory of herself since she gained her powers. Vers now trains tirelessly with Starforce Commander Yon-Rogg, with the goal of becoming a member of the team.
