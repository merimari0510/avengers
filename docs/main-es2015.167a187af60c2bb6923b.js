The police had been called there by Lewis and, consequently, attempted to arrest all three for search of private property; a policeman tries to touch Foster, but the Ether pushes him. Thor arrives suddenly, seeking to investigate Foster's well-being, since Heimdall lost sight of her after she disappeared. While rejoicing to see him, Foster slaps Thor in the face for taking two years to visit her even though he was on Earth during the Battle of New York. Thor apologizes to her, but then takes her to Asgard to investigate the nature of the Ether.","Once there, Heimdall greets them, but Jane Foster is quickly taken to the healing chambers so they can know what was happening to her. Scientists find the Ether in their body, but they don't know what it is really about. Eir tries to get Foster's Ether, but fails. Odin, furious because a human has entered Asgard, orders that they take her back to Earth, but when a guard touches her wrist, the Ether reacts defensively as he did with the policeman. Odin, recognizing the Ether, tells Foster about his many possible origins using the Book of Yggdrasil, and how the Dark Elves almost used it to destroy the worlds. While Odin works to find a way to eliminate the Ether without killing Foster, Frigga, Odin's wife, Thor's mother and Loki's adoptive mother, she befriends her. Frigga has been secretly trying to convey his disappointment to Loki regarding his actions, but he constantly rejects her. ","Meanwhile, alerted by the use of the Ether by Foster, Malekith and the Dark Elves wake up from their long sleep. Under Malekith's orders, Algrim lets himself be captured by the Asgardians disguised as a Marauder and, using vile technology, becomes Kursed, a powerful warrior that the Dark Elves frequently used in their war against the Asgardians.He frees all the prisoners, except Loki, and begins a disturbance in the dungeons, distracting the Asgardians so that Malekith can carry his squad of ships to Asgard with little opposition. A battle is generated, during which they manage to enter the palace and destroy everything in their path. Frigga confronts Malekith in a duel while creating a holographic replica of Foster. Frigga almost manages to defeat Malekith, but the Kursed intervenes and mortally wounds her when she refuses to yield to Foster and the location of the Ether. In retaliation, an enraged Thor disfigures Malekith's face with lightning, ob linking the Dark Elves to retreat. Frigga then dies from his wound.","Subsequently, a funeral is held for the dead Asgardians and Frigga. Odin, suffering from grief, imprisons Jane Foster. Thor knows that Malekith will return for Foster, but Odin, blinded by hatred and pain, refuses to release her. So, Thor has a plan to get her out, even though he would be committing treason. With Heimdall distracting Odin from them, Thor frees Loki from his cell, as Loki knows of the secret portals that could transport Foster to another world, driving Malekith away from Asgard. With the help of Sif, Fandral and Volstagg, Thor, Foster and Loki hijack a downed Dark Elf ship and manage to leave Asgard, and a hidden portal teleports them to Svartalfheim. However, while escaping, Foster's body is slowly infested by the Ether. ","The trio lands on the moors of Svartalfheim and, by then, Foster's body has completely channeled the Ether, improving his perceptions, but weakening it physically. Malekith feels the transfer of the Ether and faces the trio in Svartalfheim, and in that At the moment, Loki seems to betray Thor, cutting off his hand and handing Fk to Malekith willingly. Loki tells Malekith that in exchange for the Ether, he wants a front row seat to see Asgard's destruction. Malekith proceeds to drain the Ether of Foster's body, but Loki's betrayal is revealed as a ruse, and it is revealed that Thor's injury was nothing more than a holographic projection destined to lull Malekith with a false sense of security. Summoning the Mjolnir, Thor try to destroy the Ether, but it fails, since it is indestructible. Kursed then fights Thor while Malekith and his minions leave the planet, and Kursed quickly gains the advantage against Thor Loki comes to Thor's aid, stabbing Kursed, but this has no effect on the Kursed, who sticks the blade over Loki's body as well. Loki manages to press one of the implosion bombs, destroying the Kursed. Loki then apologizes to Thor for his actions, and seems to die in his arms. After crying to Loki, Thor and Foster enter a cave, believing that they have failed to stop Malekith. Suddenly, Foster's cell phone starts ringing and they go deeper into the cave, finding a portal. The portal teleports them safely back to London. Meanwhile, an Einherjar guard appears in the same area where Loki died, and returns to Asgard to inform Odin of what happened.","While Jane Foster was in Asgard, Darcy Lewis has been trying unsuccessfully to contact S.H.I.E.L.D. when she and Ian Boothby see in the news that Erik Selvig has been running naked in Stonehenge, and now they have put him in a retirement home to receive psychiatric care. They go there to get him out, and he tells them that his sanity was shaken after being hypnotized by Loki during the Chitauri Invasion. In recent months, Selvig has studied the effects of Convergence and has developed devices that can teleport people to different worlds. They reunite with Thor and Foster, and Selvig tells them that the people who lived in England after the previous Convergence had built certain objects to create a secret map to where the Convergence would reach its peak. The location is revealed as Greenwich. Foster theorizes that Malekith plans to extend the Ether through the portals so that he can destroy all the worlds at once. ","They travel to Greenwich the next morning and, when they arrive, they discover that several portals have been opened over the city, a sign that the Convergence is reaching its highest point. Malekith arrives, and Thor faces him in a battle, with both opponents matched. The fight moves through several portals throughout the city, transporting them to different worlds. While the two are fighting, scientists use Selvig devices to deal with the Dark Elves, accidentally summoning an icy beast. in the process, Thor and Malekith are soon separated by one of the portals, and Malekith, now without opposition, releases the Ether in the portals Thor soon regroups with his friends and takes Selvig's devices, noting that while the Ether can be indestructible, Malekith himself isn't. Using the devices, Thor impales Malekith with them, allowing Foster to teleport him back to Svartalfheim, stopping his attack, however, Malekith's damaged ship begins to crash, and almost crushes Thor and Foster, but Selvig uses the last of his devices to transport him to Svartalfheim, resulting in the ship falling on Malekith, killing him. The portals are closed and the Convergence comes to an end. ","Some time later, Thor returns to Asgard, where Odin congratulates him on his victory despite the crimes he committed in doing so. Odin tells Thor that he will be a wise king, but Thor responds by saying that he is not ready to assume the throne. Thor leaves Asgard to meet with Foster on Earth, however, when he leaves, it is revealed that Odin is Loki, who faked his death and usurped Odin's throne.","In the first post-credits scene, Sif and Volstagg give the recovered Ether to Taneleer Tivan.
