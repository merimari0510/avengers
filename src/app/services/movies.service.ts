      "Thanos arrives at Titan and is received by Strange. He gives a brief and passionate speech about how Titan was his home and that overpopulation led him to ruin, as well as being considered merciful, since with the Infinity Gems together he can eliminate half of the population in the universe without that they feel a lot of pain with the snap of their fingers, after which Thanos simply plans to rest.

      "At first, the Outriders try to pass through the protective barrier that surrounds Wakanda, which only a few manage to cross. As they try to go other ways to capture Vision, the Avengers decide to partially open the barrier to keep the enemies in front of them. The strategy works, but at the cost of massive hordes of Outriders that suddenly invade Wakanda, this leads to a fierce battle.",
      "Although they are able to take down many creatures, the Avengers and Wakanda's armies are outnumbered. However, Thor arrives by invoking the Bifrost with Rocket and Groot, taking an unexpected turn during the battle, as Thor's Stormbreaker ends up with multiple enemy troops. The Dark Order resorts to the use of massive war machines, which leads Maximoff to leave his post to join the battle and help his allies.",
      "However, this leaves Vision and Shuri exposed to Corvus Glaive, who infiltrated the lab to take the Vision Mind Gem. The latter tries to defend himself, but Corvus Glaive and Cull Obsidian dominate him.

      "However, Thanos survives the attack. He makes fun of Thor for not pointing at the head and snapping his fingers with the Infinity Gauntlet, carrying out his plan. Thanos is momentarily transported to the World of the Soul, where he sees a young Gamora, who asks him what was the cost of achieving his goal. Sadly, Thanos confesses that he lost «everything». Thanos then returns to the real world and Thor furiously questions him about what he did. Thanos simply smiles and teleports while the effects of the Snap manifest: half of life in the universe is erased from existence, including James Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Wanda Maximoff and Samuel Wilson, leaving survivors to contemplate in horror, unable to do anything other than accept defeat.",

Peter Parker also disintegrates and hugs Stark telling him he didn't want to leave, until he disappeared.

Bajo su tutela, ella anota una diana, y Barton la felicita por su esfuerzo. Cerca de allí, Laura prepara un picnic mientras sus dos hijos, Nathaniel y Cooper, juegan con la pelota. Barton desvía su atención de Lila por un momento para responderle a su esposa, pero cuando regresa su atención a Lila, ella no está. Sorprendido, él llama a su familia que está detrás suyo, pero descubre que también se desvanecieron a causa del chasquido de Thanos.",
      "Tres semanas después del Chasquido, Anthony Stark y Nebula están a la deriva en el espacio a bordo del Benatar. Como estaban casi agotados de suministros, Stark usa el casco del Mark L para grabarle un último mensaje a Virginia Potts. A pesar de su situación, él comenta que los dos se han vuelto buenos amigos, describiendo a Nebula positivamente como «práctica» y «sádica», refiriéndose a los momentos en que ella estaba atendiendo sus heridas y le ayudó a mantener la nave en función, mientras intentaban sobrevivir al viaje de regreso a la Tierra. Stark termina de grabar su mensaje y lo dirige a Potts antes de quedarse dormido. Nebula lo coloca en el asiento del capitán y se retira a los corredores de la nave. Más tarde, Stark despierta cuando una luz brillante aparece al frente del Benatar. De la luz emerge Carol Danvers, quien lleva la nave de regreso al Centro de los Nuevos Vengadores en la Tierra.",
      "Stark se reúne con Potts y los Vengadores restantes que sobrevivieron, que incluía a Natalia Romanoff, Bruce Banner, James Rhodes y Steven Rogers. Stark le dice a Rogers que perdió a Peter Parker, y Rogers le dice que todos perdieron. Rocket Raccoon ve a Nebula sola y deduce que sus amigos también murieron; él se sienta a su lado y se dan la mano. Dentro de la instalación, Rogers le pregunta a Stark si tiene alguna pista sobre dónde podría estar Thanos, pero Stark irrumpe en una furiosa diatriba basado en los problemas no resueltos entre ellos tras la Guerra Civil, diciéndole que si se hubieran mantenido juntos, habrían derrotado a Thanos. Después de discutir, Stark se rinde, se quita su Reactor Arc y se desmaya, agotado de su viaje en el espacio, por lo que recibe un sedante que lo mantendría dormido por el resto del día.",
      "Volviendo al tema de tratar de encontrar a Thanos, Danvers se propuso a contactar a alguien que podría saber su ubicación, pero Nebula le dice que no hay necesidad de hacerlo porque ella sabe dónde está Thanos, haciendo referencia al «Jardín» que Thanos le mencionó en el pasado cuando le preguntó a dónde iría después de lograr su objetivo. Basándose en su información, Rocket extrae un holograma de su ubicación y afirma que cuando Thanos usó las Gemas del Infinito en la Tierra soltó una gran explosión de energía, y que dicha energía reapareció hace dos días en un planeta lejano. Con esta nueva pista, los Vengadores se disponen a enfrentar a Thanos para recuperar las Gemas del Infinito, con la esperanza de traer de vuelta a la mitad de la población del universo. Thor, culpándose a sí mismo por lo que sucedió cuando ignoró su oportunidad de matar a Thanos antes de desencadenar el Chasquido, decidió unirse al equipo para compensar su error.",

En su choza, Thanos, afectado por horribles quemaduras, continúa con su rutina diaria, sin embargo, los Vengadores llegaron para enfrentarlo.

No obstante, para sorpresa de los Vengadores, el Guantelete no contenía las Gemas.",
      "Thanos explica que después de haber llevado a cabo su misión, las Gemas habían cumplido su propósito y, por lo tanto, las usó una última vez para destruirlas con sus propias energías, de modo que el Chasquido fuera irreversible. Los Vengadores lo acusaron de mentir, a lo que Nebula responde que, si bien su padre es muchas cosas, jamás mentiría. Thanos le agradece a su «hija» por creerle, y se lamenta por haberla tratado con dureza. Sin embargo, estas fueron las últimas palabras de Thanos, ya que un enfurecido Thor lo decapita con el Rompetormentas. Cuando Rocket le pregunta qué ha hecho, Thor responde que esta vez «apuntó la cabeza». Los Vengadores se ven obligados a aceptar que no hay manera de devolver las cosas a la normalidad, y abandonan el planeta.",

After concluding the meeting, Rhodes tells Romanoff that his former partner, Clinton Barton, has been in Mexico operating as a judge and suspects that he is responsible for the deaths of several cartel members.

      "Rogers comes in to tell him that although they try to help others overcome what happened, none of them could. Suddenly, Lang arrives at the complex, and although initially they were skeptical, the two are surprised to see that Lang is really still alive. The three begin to talk about their means of survival, where Lang explains his experience in the Quantum Kingdom, since he was trapped there for five hours, and upon leaving he realized that five years passed on Earth. Based on the latter, Lang mentions the possibility of using the Quantum Kingdom to travel back in time and reverse the Click. The trio, with limited knowledge about the Quantum Kingdom, decides to go find Anthony Stark.",
      "Anthony Stark lives in a simple cabin with Virginia Potts and his little daughter Morgan, feeling at peace despite what he lived during the Infinity War. He enjoys playing next to his daughter, but seeing Rogers, Romanoff and Lang arrive, Stark immediately deduces what they came for. When Lang proposes the idea of ​​a «Time Heist», Stark quickly criticizes the proposed proposal, fearing that he may lose his family in the process, so he prefers to let it go and tells them that he is done with the Avengers.",

As a result of the Infinity War, both the defeat of Hulk and Banner at the hands of Thanos caused Banner to resume his investigation of Gamma Radiation, and used it to have the appearance and strength of Hulk, while retaining Banner intelligence and control.

Although he hoped to fail, he discovers the key to doing so, solving how to navigate the current of time travel using a strip design based on the Möbius. He talks to Potts about the morality of time travel and what he should do with his latest discovery: if he should lock it in a box and throw it at the bottom of the lake or not. Stark feels that he and Potts were fortunate that both were saved and had an incredible life together, but now he cannot deny that everyone around them has suffered unimaginable horrors and should receive help, with Potts encouraging him to do the right thing.",
      "In the New Avengers Center, Banner, Rogers and Romanoff try to send Lang to travel through time, but they only manage to make Lang age and constantly rejuvenate, until he returns to normal. Rogers leaves the complex thinking what to do next, just to see Stark arriving at the facility with his car. When Stark asks if «the whole team» is joining, Rogers tells him they are still working on that. Stark tells him that he agrees to help with the condition that the reversal they will make does not alter the life he has with his current family. Rogers agrees that this should be the case, they make passes, and Stark returns his shield of Captain America to Rogers.",

Upon entering his home, Banner and Rocket find Thor sunk in a depression after their failures; He has gained considerable weight, has become an alcoholic carefree for his people and spends much of his time playing video games with Korg and Miek.

Once the test proved to be a success, the Avengers continue with the next phase of preparation, which consists in determining the location of each Infinity Gem in the past. While the team discusses the strategy to be applied, Rhodes suggests that it may be better to kill a «Baby Thanos», but Banner says that altering past events will not alter his present, but will create an alternative universe. On the other hand, the Avengers had few supplies of Pym Particles to use, which limited their time travel.",
      "Eventually, the team realizes that the Gems of Time, Space and Mind were present in New York in 2012, relatively close to each other, after the Battle of New York. However, the other three Gems were only accessible to them in completely different places and times, such as the Gem of Reality in Asgard in 2013, and the Gem of Power and Soul in 2014 in Morag and Vormir, respectively.

Vers has constant nightmares chasing her, which consist mainly of a plane crash in a deserted field and sees a woman killed in front of her by an unknown aggressor. She also has this experience as the first memory of herself since she gained her powers. Vers now trains tirelessly with Starforce Commander Yon-Rogg, with the goal of becoming a member of the team. Despite Vers's lack of moderation, the Supreme Intelligence of the Kree Empire figured it was ready and allowed Vers to join the Starforce, along with the sniper Minn-Erva and the operatives Korath, Bron-Char and Att-Lass.",

Talos and Norex arrive at the Rambeau Residence, only to negotiate a temporary alliance. Talos reveals that Danvers had been fooled by the Kree, and that the Skrulls are simply homeless refugees on the verge of extinction constantly fleeing the Kree Empire. He also reveals to Danvers that Lawson was actually a double Kree agent named Mar-Vell who was trying to help the Skrulls by manufacturing the Speed ​​of Light Engine, which could help them run away from the Kree's reach forever. Finally, Talos tells him about a concealed ship in Earth's orbit, an old laboratory that Mar-Vell had used, which contains other Skrulls refugees.",
      "After this revelation, and after Talos activated a recorded message confirming Danvers' role in the plane crash, she suddenly remembers what happened: the murder of the woman, Mar-Vell, was orchestrated by Yon-Rogg and the Starforce , who discovered the betrayal of the Kree. Mar-Vell instructed Danvers to destroy the energy core that powers the Speed ​​of Light Engine, but in an attempt to destroy it, Danvers acquired cosmic abilities after absorbing the engine's energy when it exploded. Without any recollection of it, Yon-Rogg was authorized by the Supreme Intelligence to train her to become a Kree agent after having a blood transfusion. With the truth exposed, Danvers decides to support the Skrulls, and lets Monica change the colors of her suit from green to one with the colors red, blue and yellow.",

However, he quickly discovers that Danvers is actually the Skrull Norex, and quickly executes it upon learning of the lab that orbits the Earth. Danvers, Fury, Talos, Maria and Goose direct the Quadjet to Mar-Vell's laboratory, and Talos reunites with his family. Danvers finds the source of the energy core, the Teseracto, but the Starforce comes to face them. In a final conversation with the Supreme Intelligence, Danvers criticizes her for making her live a lie and eliminates the inhibitor that has been limiting her true potential.",
      "A battle is carried out; Fury discovers that Goose is not a cat, but a Flerken, and witnesses her first-hand skills after she swallows the Teseracto and several Kree soldiers. In a battle to obtain the Teseracto, supposedly hidden in a lunchbox, Danvers quickly surpasses the Starforce, while the Skrulls escape in the Quadjet with Rambeau and Fury. Yon-Rogg instructs Minn-Erva, the last operable member of the Starforce, to take down the Quadjet, but Rambeau shoots towards the Minn-Erva spacecraft and removes it.",
      "As an emergency resource, Yon-Rogg authorizes Ronan, a Kree warlord with whom he has been in contact all this time, to send Kree ballistic missiles to Earth to assassinate Danvers and the Skrulls. Danvers quickly destroys the missiles, leading Ronan to retire when he realizes he was no match for her. Yon-Rogg arrives on Earth and, with all determination, challenges Danvers to a hand-to-hand duel, just like his previous Hala training exercises. Instead, Danvers stuns Yon-Rogg with a photonic explosion and returns him on his ship to Hala with a warning to the Supreme Intelligence that she will end the war.",
      "As a result, Goose scratches Fury's left eye in an unsuspecting act, blinding him. The Skrulls seek temporary shelter at the Rambeau Residence, where Danvers swears to find them a new home. Before Danvers leaves Earth with the Skrulls, she gives Fury her modified Pager Transmitter to contact her in case of an extreme emergency and recommends keeping the Teseracto, which was still in Goose's stomach. After these events, Coulson meets with Fury in Los Angeles to begin the Protectors Initiative, which would help them form a special team to fight against future international and alien threats. Upon learning that Danvers' nickname was «Avenger» during his time in the Air Force, Fury renamed the project Avengers Initiative in his honor.",
