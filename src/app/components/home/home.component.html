    <p class="pl-5 pr-5 pt-3">When we do something new we have fear and uncertainty and it is normal, we have all gone through this phase, the difference is that some people stay there and others make the leap to face things with attitude and enthusiasm. Let your dreams or goals be stronger than your fears.</p>

    <p>This is a question that many ask lately, what movie goes before what? If a person decides to see them all together now, it is impossible only with the titles and covers to know which one to start.</p>
    <p>Although the movies of the heroes separately are more or less independent, there is a small thread that forces you to watch certain movies before others.</p>
    <p>It should be noted that Marvel is delivering the movies in phases. Each phase contains several films of the heroes alone that end with one of the Avengers together. Therefore, each Avengers movie can be considered the end of a story arc.</p>
