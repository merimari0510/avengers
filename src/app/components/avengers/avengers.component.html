    <p class="lead text-center mb-5">The Avengers are, today, the most famous Marvel superhero group.</p>
    <p>«<strong>Avengers, gather together!</strong>» Two words to describe «<strong>The Avengers</strong>», a group always so united but at the same time so disjointed. And is that this group of heroes that one day in September 1963, have always fought side by side, as an enviable unit, but at the same time, throughout its history, it has suffered the ideas and comings of all its components, to the point that one of its founders, <a [routerLink] = "['/avenger','hulk']">Hulk</a>, barely lasted a few weeks in the group.</p>
    <p>The Avengers arose, of course, from the magnificent imagination of <em>Stan Lee</em> and the pencils of <em>Jack Kirby</em>. In that first issue also intervened, in the ink, <em>Dick Ayers</em>, and, curiously, his story, at least in fiction, began by chance. <a [routerLink] = "['/avenger','hulk']">Hulk</a> had been tricked by Loki and caused a train accident. Rick Jones, the everlasting friend of <a [routerLink] = "['/avenger','hulk']">Hulk</a> tried to warn the Fantastic Four (the only group of heroes at the time), but Loki intercepted the call by diverting it. The recipient of that call was Thor, but in addition, Hank Pym, the <a [routerLink] = "['/avenger','ant-man']">Ant-Man</a>, his wife, The Wasp and <a [routerLink] = "['/avenger','iron-man']">Iron Man</a>, caught her, appearing at the scene of the accident.</p>
    <p>When they captured Loki and demonstrated <a [routerLink] = "['/avenger','hulk']">Hulk</a>'s innocence, the idea of ​​forming a group that fought against "the bad guys" arose, and La Avispa, jokingly, suggested the idea of ​​putting on a name that was blunt and dramatic: «The Avengers».</p>
    <p>Since then, and there are 46 years behind him, they have lived countless stories both personal and in groups. Many heroes are gone and others have arrived; the truth is that almost all the "good" superheroes that I remember have passed through their ranks. In fact, <a [routerLink] = "['/avenger','hulk']">Hulk</a> left within a few weeks, and when <a [routerLink] = "['/avenger','captain-america']">Captain America</a> was found frozen in the Arctic by the avengers, when he came back to life, he ended up commanding the group after the withdrawal of all its founders. <a [routerLink] = "['/avenger','hawkeye']">Hawkeye</a>, the <a [routerLink] = "['/avenger','scarlet-witch']">Scarlet Witch</a>, Mercury were the next to be part of a group of which only <a [routerLink] = "['/avenger','captain-america']">Captain America</a> remained. But then came <a [routerLink] = "['/avenger','vision']">The Vision</a>, which would be created by one of the group's arch nemesis, the Ultron robot, in turn created by mistake by Hank Pym.</p>
    <p>We live the romance between the android <a [routerLink] = "['/avenger','vision']">The Vision</a> and the <a [routerLink] = "['/avenger','scarlet-witch']">Scarlet Witch</a>. We saw how it ended up crazy and destroying Stark's Mansion and the group in "Avengers Disjointed"; we saw them fight beyond the ends of the earth in the Kree-shi'ar war in "Operation Galactic Storm", and we have even seen groups of Avengers in various areas of the US fighting as groups dependent on the principal, as in the case from The Avengers of the West Coast, commanded by <a [routerLink] = "['/avenger','hawkeye']">Hawkeye</a> with his wife, Bird Mocking, and with Tigra and Wonder Man as founding members.</p>
    <p>The Avengers overflow action, although they also have a part that has always been highly criticized: and it is the lack of depth of their characters. Although scenes of everyday life have been lived in the marriage between Hank Pym and La Avispa, for example, the truth is that the Avengers scripts have always focused on their confrontations with villains, and have left aside other issues of a psychological nature</p>
    <p>Like all heroes have been transforming, but the essence of Marvel has remained: The Fantastic Four and they, The Avengers, are the two great groups of heroes in the world of comics. They are the saviors of America (and of the world, of course); they are the ones that relate directly to the US government, and after all, they are the ones who impose their law. Characters like <a [routerLink] = "['/avenger','iron-man']">Iron Man</a>, <a [routerLink] = "['/avenger','captain-marvel']">Ms. Marvel</a> or the <a [routerLink] = "['/avenger','black-widow']">Black Widow</a> have seen their prominence enlarge, and today, they are basically the ones fighting against the greatest dangers of Humanity ...</p>
